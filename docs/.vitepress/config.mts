// asset 404s. A custom domain serves from the root instead, hence the override:
// `DOCS_BASE=/ bun run build` produces a build for root-domain hosting.
//
// The trailing slash is required, not cosmetic. VitePress asserts that `base`
// both starts and ends with `/`, and every `head` entry below interpolates it
// directly — without it, `${base}favicon.svg` resolves to the single path
// segment `/rust-toolchainfavicon.svg`.

// this machine also claims. `strictPort` makes a collision fail loudly instead
// of silently landing on 5174 and printing a URL nobody reads.
//
// DEV ONLY. `vitepress preview` does not run Vite's preview server -- it serves
// the built directory with Polka -- so a `vite.preview` block here is read by
// nothing and the command lands on its own 4173 default. Verified: with that
// block present, `bun run preview` still printed 4173. The preview port is
// therefore passed as a CLI flag from package.json, which honours DOCS_PORT the
// same way this does.
